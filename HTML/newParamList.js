Further, when the mixing results from shear turbulence rather than thermal mixing this parameter is not useful for glider flying.

Larger values indicate greater uncertainty/variability and thus better thermalling over local 'hot spots' or small-scale topography not resolved by the model.  But larger values also indicate greater sensitivity to error in the predicted surface temperature, so actual conditions have a greater likelihood of differing from those predicted.  Small values often result from the presence of a stable (inversion) layer capping and limiting thermal growth.

Positive convergence is associated with local small-scale convergence lines (often called 'shear lines' by pilots, which are horizontal changes of wind speed/direction) - however, the actual size of such features is much smaller than can be resolved by the model so only stronger ones will be forecast and their predictions are subject to much error.  If CAPE is also large, thunderstorms can be triggered.  Negative convergence (divergence) produces subsiding vertical motion, creating low-level inversions which limit thermalling heights.  This parameter can be noisy, so users should be wary.  For a grid resolution of 12km or better convergence lines created by terrain are commonly predicted - sea-breeze predictions can also be found for strong cases, though they are best resolved by smaller-resolution grids."];

Clouds can also occur with negative values if the air is lifted up the indicated vertical distance by flow up a small-scale ridge not resolved by the model's smoothed topography."];

The surface LCL (Lifting Condensation Level) is the level to which humid air must ascend before it cools enough to reach a dew point temperature based on the surface mixing ratio and is therefore relevant only to small clouds - unlike the below BL-based CL which uses a BL-averaged humidity.  However, this parameter has a theoretical difficulty and quite possibly that the actual cloudbase will be higher than given here - so perhaps this should be considered a minimum possible cloudbase."];

paramList["zsfclclmask"] = ["", "Cu Cloudbase where CuPotential > 0", "This plot is a combination of the value of the 'Cumulus Potential for non-extensive puffy cloud' (LCL - which indicates areas where cloud may form) and the 'Lifted Condensation Level' (the level to which humid air must rise to form cloud). It thus depicts the Cumulus Cloudbase at locations where cumulus may form and so alleviates the need to look at both Cumulus Potential and Cumulus Cloudbase plots. Note that the threshold Cumulus Potential should be empirically determined for your site, which has not been done for the UK: it is assumed to approximate to the theoretical value of zero.  For locations where the actual threshold is greater than zero, as is often the case, this depiction will over-estimate the extent of the cumulus region."];

paramList["blcwbase"] = ["full", "BL Cld-Base if CloudWater predicted", "This parameter is primarily for DrJack's use.  It predicts the cloud base of extensive clouds based on model-predicted formation of cloud water, giving the lowest height at which the predicted cloud water density is above a criterion value within the BL.  In theory it should be useful predicting OvercastDevelopment (OD) within the BL since it predicts extensive cloudiness, i.e. when BL clouds are predicted to extend over a full model gridcell volume.  However, the criterion to be used to indicate the presence of clouds is problematical since no single value reliably differentiates between 'mist' and 'cloud' concentrations.  This parameter has not yet been verified again actual conditions - comparision to flight observations will be needed to evaluate its usefulness."];

paramList["blcloudpct"] = ["full", "BL Cloud Cover", "This parameter provides an additional means of evaluating the formation of clouds within the BL and might be used either in conjunction with or instead of the other cloud prediction parameters.  It assumes a very simple relationship between cloud cover percentage and the maximum relative humidity within the BL.  The cloud base height is not predicted, but is expected to be below the BL Top height.  DrJack does not have a lot of faith in this prediction, since the formula used is so simple, and expects its predictions to be very approximate - but other meteorologists have used it and it is better than nothing.  Note: Since The the 'BL Cloud Cover', 'Cumulus Potential', and 'BL Extensive CloudBase' are based upon fundamentally different model predictions -- respectively the predicted maximum moisture in the BL, the predicted surface moisture, and an explicit cloud-water prediction -- they can yield somewhat differing predictions, e.g. the 'Cumulus Potential' can predict puffy cloud formation when the 'BL Cloud Cover' is zero or vice versa."];

paramList["cape"] = ["full", "CAPE", "Convective Available Potential Energy indicates the atmospheric stability affecting deep convective cloud formation above the BL.  A higher value indicates greater potential instability, larger updraft velocities within deep convective clouds, and greater potential for thunderstorm development (since a trigger is needed to release that potential).  Note that thunderstorms may develop in regions of high CAPE and then get transported downwind to regions of lower CAPE.  Also, locations where both convergence and CAPE values are high can be subject to explosive thunderstorm development."];

paramList["blicw"] = ["full", "BL Integrated Cloud Water", "This parameter is primarily for DrJack's use.
